<h2>What is Fishkeeping?</h2>
<p>
  Fishkeeping is a popular hobby, practiced by aquarists, concerned with keeping fish in a home
  aquarium or garden pond. There is also a piscicultural fishkeeping industry, serving as a branch
  of agriculture.

  Fishkeepers are often known as "aquarists" since many of them are not solely interested in keeping
  fish. The hobby can be broadly divided into three specific disciplines, depending on the type of
  water the fish originate from: freshwater, brackish, and marine (also called saltwater)
  fishkeeping.
